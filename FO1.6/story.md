Title: Courange (Brave Orange)

Main Plot: As the story unfolds, it is revealed that Lilith has been manipulating Adam all along, even after she "confessed" her past transgressions. Adam, with a renowned taste for shamanism, was nearly assassinated and spent three years in a deep coma. Lilith, 26, his supposed wife, is responsible, acting as a double agent for a secret rogue agency that competes with the government over control of hidden spiritual technology. They kept it hidden to manipulate and control the human population.

Adam and Lilith uncover the hidden Serpent truth after finding hints of alchemical hidden equations that solve the paradox of creation (multidimensional/paradoxical) at Adam's hidden lab. Their mission now becomes exposing the conspiracy and bringing down the organization responsible for hiding the truth, all while evading their pursuers and navigating a world still overrun by hordes of minibots, gorilla ninjas, and armored rubber ducks. The twist in this storyline is the discovery of the conspiracy and the struggle to take down a powerful enemy that has been controlling the world from the shadows.
