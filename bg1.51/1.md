Antagonist: Lilith, Adam's wife, a controlling and enigmatic woman who seems to have her own agenda.
Conflict: Adam's struggle to understand his past, the nature of his coma, and his relationship with Lilith while navigating various dreamscapes and realities.
Dialogue: Dialogue should be used to reveal character motivations, provide background information, and create tension between characters, especially between Adam and Lilith.
Theme: The exploration of personal growth, self-discovery, and the interplay between reality and imagination.
Tone: Dark, humorous, and fantastical, with a strong sense of suspense and intrigue.
Pacing: The pacing should vary between fast-paced dream sequences and slower, more introspective moments in reality. Build tension through Adam's journey of self-discovery and his struggle to understand his past and the nature of his coma.

Optional: The story should be written as a dark humor fantastical thriller, with an emphasis on Adam's imaginative journey and its connection to his personal growth and self-discovery.
