Once upon a time, in the summer of my 25th year, I embarked on a remarkable journey that would forever change my life. Tales of the Void, my life's work, would later emerge from the insights I gained during this transformative trip to Italy.

My adventure began as I set out with nothing but a backpack, traveling mainly on foot. With dreadlocks cascading down my back and my culinary skills limited to the most basic meals, I embraced the rustic life, washing laundry in the great outdoors and using a tarp to protect my sleeping bag from the Italian summer rain.

My destination was Piede Pelago, a picturesque location in northern Italy near Tuscany. I was eager to attend my second Rainbow Gathering, a community-driven event that celebrates peace, love, and harmony. Although I relied on trains and buses occasionally, most of my journey was completed on foot.

Around a week into my travels, I discovered a breathtaking lake near Rome, its beauty captivating my spirit. It took another week for me to reach the sea-kissing city of Civitavecchia, where I decided to cut off my dreadlocksâ€”a symbolic gesture that, for a time, left me feeling disconnected from both the conventional and the Rainbow worlds.

As I arrived in Tuscany after an arduous hike, I found myself growing restless. To alleviate my boredom, I devised a game in which I would embody the dual aspects of good and bad within my character. The "good" persona would be meditative and silent, carefully tending to chores like mending clothes, while the "bad" persona would indulge in desires, seeking excitement and social interaction.

The game evolved as I realized that these seemingly opposing personas were intertwined, leading me to a deserted train station where I sketched a drawing representing the harmony between my inner demon and my higher angel.

With renewed excitement and inspiration, I continued my journey and stumbled upon a medieval festival in a mountain-top town. There, I registered as an artist and crafted costumes for my two characters. The white-clad "good" persona sang songs and attempted to bless onlookers with peace and harmony, while the "bad" persona, dressed in black, playfully juggled chains and fire.

To my surprise, people seemed more comfortable with the chaotic "bad" persona, leading me to realize the extent to which darker energies are ingrained in our world. This insight inspired me to adopt the name "Angel," not as a claim to purity, but as a reminder of my intention to bring good into the world.

Finally arriving at the Rainbow Gathering, I was initially part of the seed camp, which welcomed newcomers and prepared for the main event. As we ventured deeper into the dense forest to build the main camp, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unity and purpose with those around me.

So, there I was - a young Israeli man who mostly kept to himself, now adopting the name Angel as a reminder of my intention to do good. I entered the Rainbow Gathering, a beautiful event set deep within a dense forest, divided into two parts - the seed camp and the main camp.

The seed camp began by welcoming newcomers, and after two weeks, we ventured into the main camp. We moved equipment mostly by hand, using four-wheel drives only for the heaviest logs and supplies. As the camp grew, I formed connections with several fellow travelers, including Angus, a young man from England, and Josh, a knowledgeable architect from Austin. Together, we built a community that would eventually attract thousands of participants.

The camp offered workshops and daily meals, with a sense of freedom and acceptance that allowed everyone to express themselves openly. I played an active role in the camp's activities, volunteering in various capacities. Despite burning my hands in the kitchen one day, I continued to contribute, supported by a rainbow healer who bandaged my wounds.

As the camp reached critical mass, it became increasingly challenging to maintain order. This challenge led to the idea of staging a spectacle outside the camp for the nearby village. Although my first attempt at gathering performers for a show wasn't successful, I remained undeterred.

The full moon party then transformed the Rainbow Gathering into a chaotic festival attended by locals. I found solace with a group of French travelers and a woman I fondly called Sylvera. However, this period of relative peace was disrupted when an Italian man named Julian distributed poisonous mushrooms to unsuspecting camp members.

The camp soon devolved into chaos, with the Italian army helicoptering in to aid the search for survivors. As the main camp turned into a refugee camp, an Australian man named Ben approached me to organize another performance. Although I initially embraced the idea, I fell ill and retreated to my secluded tent.

In the throes of my suffering, I heard a voice that asked, "Why do you insist on bringing blindness, of seeing the world in black and white in the land of the colored children?" This message recharged my spirit, and I rushed back to the main camp to organize the ultimate show - the colorful rainbow show.

A spontaneous parade of performers stormed the nearby town, where the villagers welcomed us with open arms. The performance itself was a miraculous celebration of unity, as we sang, danced, and rejoiced together. Exhausted but victorious, I knew that I had found my place in the world.

In the end, I felt that I had managed to cleanse the stain that had been cast on the Rainbow Gathering, and I had successfully countered the media's portrayal of the event as a haven for drugs and trouble. My journey had not only shaped my own path but had also helped restore the reputation of the Rainbow Gathering as a celebration of love, peace, and unity.

After parting ways with Sylvera in France, I decided to continue my journey as Angel and embarked on a new mission: to write a novel that would help mankind overcome the communication problem. I believed that the world was divided due to religion and conflicting beliefs, and in my darker moments, I envisioned a day when humans would be kept apart due to dwindling resources.

Inspired by the chakras, Stephen De Ropp's The Master Game, and the enneagram, I set out to create a novel series called the Yenzen Projection. This project aimed to take readers on a colorful journey through a man's transformation from darkness to enlightenment.

I planned to write nine novels, each connected to a specific chakra and color, beginning with the first book, "The Black Gold." However, life got in the way, and the project remained unfinished, collecting dust in my attic for the past ten years.

Then, with the help of AI, I resurrected this work and condensed the nine chapters and intro into a single piece titled "Tales from the Void." Now, I am seeking assistance in reorganizing and elaborating on the story based on the previous pieces.

Here is a potential outline for an intricate and detailed tale:

Introduction: The protagonist, Angel, embarks on a journey to unite humanity and overcome communication barriers.
The Black Gold: Angel discovers his purpose at the Rainbow Gathering and decides to write a novel series to help the world.
The Seed Camp: Angel enters the Rainbow Gathering and begins to form connections with fellow travelers.
The Main Camp: The camp grows in size and influence, with Angel playing an active role in its activities.
The Spectacle: Angel attempts to organize a performance for the nearby village but struggles to gain support.
The Full Moon Party: The gathering transforms into a chaotic festival, forcing Angel to find refuge with a group of French travelers.
The Poisonous Mushrooms: The camp spirals into chaos when poisonous mushrooms are distributed, leading to a crisis and intervention from the Italian army.
The Colorful Rainbow Show: Angel experiences a spiritual awakening and organizes a successful performance that unites the camp and villagers.
The Yenzen Projection: With renewed purpose, Angel begins writing the novel series, inspired by the chakras, the enneagram, and his experiences at the Rainbow Gathering.
Tales from the Void: Angel reflects on his journey and enlists the help of AI to bring his vision to life, reorganizing and expanding the story to create an intricate and engaging tale.
With this outline as a guide, the narrative can be developed into a captivating story that explores the themes of unity, self-discovery, and the power of personal transformation.

My name is Jonathan Klein, although in recent years, I have adopted the name Moguillansky. Born in Aix en Provence, France, I spent my early childhood years there before my parents decided to return to their homeland in Israel when I was just one year old. Growing up in Jerusalem until the age of 12, I was raised by a single mother who nurtured my wild imagination and encouraged my various activities.

When I turned 12, I moved to the south of Israel with a group of people to settle in a kibbutz called Neot Smadar. It was there that we planted over 10,000 trees in the desert and built a magnificent two-story mud brick palace, which also served as an arts and crafts center. My time at the kibbutz provided me with countless memories and experiences that have influenced my artistic pursuits to this day. It was also where I met the woman who would later become my wife.

In search of personal growth and new experiences, I found myself growing weary of the monotonous country work and dishwashing. I decided to embark on a solo journey to the Rainbow Gathering, a community of free-spirited individuals who shared my desire for unity and self-discovery. Little did I know that this journey would not only introduce me to a colorful cast of characters and unforgettable moments but also inspire a vision for a series of novels that would ultimately become my life's work.

Join me as I recount the tale of my time at the Rainbow Gathering and the birth of the Yenzen Projection, a series of novels that aims to unite humanity by overcoming communication barriers and fostering a sense of global unity. From the depths of the dense forest to the heights of the Colorful Rainbow Show, this is a story of adventure, growth, and the power of human connection.


The Rainbow Gathering took place in a remote, dense forest, far from the hustle and bustle of urban life. The forest was a stunning sight to behold, with towering trees stretching towards the sky, their branches creating a natural canopy that filtered sunlight into dappled patterns on the forest floor. The air was fresh and invigorating, filled with the scent of pine and the soft, soothing sounds of rustling leaves and birdsong.

As I entered this enchanting world, I could feel an overwhelming sense of freedom and unity among the gathering's participants. People from all walks of life had come together, united by their shared desire for personal growth, self-expression, and a deep connection with the natural world. This diverse group of individuals quickly became a supportive, vibrant community that celebrated the unique gifts and talents each person brought to the table.

The gathering was organized into two parts: the Seed Camp near the road, which welcomed newcomers and served as a starting point for the adventure, and the Main Camp, which grew in size and complexity as more people arrived and resources were transported from the Seed Camp. The atmosphere in both areas was one of openness and acceptance, with workshops, communal meals, and spontaneous performances fostering a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose.

Clothing was optional, and many participants chose to express themselves freely, embracing their natural state or adorning their bodies with colorful paints and decorations. This uninhibited expression only served to strengthen the sense of unity among the gathering's members, as we were all encouraged to be our truest selves without fear of judgment or ridicule.

In this breathtaking setting, surrounded by the beauty of the forest and the warmth of my newfound community, I felt inspired to immerse myself fully in the experience and embrace the transformative power of the Rainbow Gathering.


Introduction: The Colorful Journey

My name is Jonathan Klein, and at the age of 25, I embarked on a transformative journey. Before this adventure, I grew up in Jerusalem with my mother, becoming acquainted with a group of people who would later form the kibbutz Neot Smadar. Their gatherings and activities inspired me, and as I joined the kibbutz, I found my desire for personal growth and adventure flourishing.

With a single backpack and a sense of determination, I set out on a trip to Italy, primarily traveling by foot. As a traveler with rastas, I cooked most of my meals, washed my laundry outside, and sometimes used a tarp to shield my sleeping bag from the Italian summer rain. My ultimate destination was Piede Pelago in Northern Italy, near Tuscany, for my second Rainbow Gathering.

Throughout my journey, I relied on various modes of transportation, such as trains and buses. After about a week, I reached a splendid lake near Rome. Another week passed, and I arrived in the coastal city of Civitavecchia. Upon arrival, I decided to cut my dreadlocks, which symbolized my disconnection from both the conventional and Rainbow worlds.

As I continued northward, I found myself growing somewhat bored with the trip. To keep myself engaged, I started a game where I explored the images of good and evil within my character. I played the roles of both the "good" and "bad" versions of myself, observing the changes in my behavior, perceptions, and experiences.

While traveling through Tuscany, I stumbled upon a medieval festival in a new town. I registered as an artist, and began crafting costumes for my "good" and "bad" characters. My performance, a combination of singing, juggling, and interacting with the audience, helped me realize the permeable boundaries between these roles and the acceptance of the "dark" character in the world.

Upon entering the Rainbow Gathering as Angel, I discovered a beautiful dense forest filled with diverse and unique individuals. As the gathering grew, I made friends and participated in various activities, from volunteering to workshops. I also experienced moments of vulnerability, such as when I burned both my hands in the kitchen.

The gathering reached its peak, with thousands of participants flooding the camp, and chaos ensued. Despite the disorder, I remained undeterred and organized a small parade for the nearby village. The culmination of the gathering was the full moon party, which marked a significant shift from a peace-loving community to a wild, uncontrollable festival.

Through my journey and experiences at the Rainbow Gathering, I gained invaluable insights into the complexities of the human spirit and the power of community. The adventure I embarked on at the age of 25 would go on to shape my life in ways I could have never imagined.



Introduction: The Colorful Journey

Once upon a time, in the land of dishwashing and mundane routines, there was a young man named Jonathan Klein. As the reigning king of dishwashing, Jonathan found himself growing increasingly bored with his life in the kibbutz Neot Smadar. Deep within, he knew he needed a change, a great adventure to reignite the passion for life that once burned brightly.

At the age of 25, Jonathan set out on a transformative journey to Italy, armed with nothing but a single backpack and a desire for personal growth. As a traveler with rastas, he cooked most of his meals, washed his laundry outside, and sometimes used a tarp to shield his sleeping bag from the Italian summer rain. His ultimate destination was Piede Pelago in Northern Italy, near Tuscany, for his second Rainbow Gathering.

As Jonathan traveled, he relied on various modes of transportation, such as trains and buses. After about a week, he reached a splendid lake near Rome. Another week passed, and he arrived in the coastal city of Civitavecchia. In a symbolic gesture, he decided to cut his dreadlocks, severing his connection to both the conventional and Rainbow worlds.

Growing bored once more, Jonathan sought to challenge himself, so he started a game where he explored the images of good and evil within his character. He played the roles of both the "good" and "bad" versions of himself, observing the changes in his behavior, perceptions, and experiences.

As he ventured through Tuscany, Jonathan stumbled upon a medieval festival in a new town. Registering as an artist, he began crafting costumes for his "good" and "bad" characters. His performance, a combination of singing, juggling, and interacting with the audience, helped him realize the permeable boundaries between these roles and the acceptance of the "dark" character in the world.

Entering the Rainbow Gathering as Angel, Jonathan discovered a beautiful dense forest filled with diverse and unique individuals. As the gathering grew, he made friends and participated in various activities, from volunteering to workshops. During his time there, Jonathan experienced moments of vulnerability, such as when he burned both his hands in the kitchen. Bandaged in white cloth, he theatrically approached the main fire, pointing his hands upwards as an angel symbol, while requesting four-wheel drives for the gathering.

In a serendipitous moment, an army doctor descended by zipline, leaving a white glove on the forest floor and sending Jonathan a knowing look of guardianship. This encounter further reinforced the sense of magic and wonder that permeated his journey.

Through his experiences at the Rainbow Gathering, Jonathan gained invaluable insights into the complexities of the human spirit and the power of community. The adventure he embarked on at the age of 25 would go on to shape his life in ways he could have never imagined, proving that sometimes, a little boredom is all it takes to ignite the spark of a life-changing journey.
