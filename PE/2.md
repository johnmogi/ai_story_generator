Once upon a time, in the land of mundane dishwashing and desert landscapes, there was a young man named Jonathan Klein. As the reigning king of dishwashing in the kibbutz Neot Smadar, Jonathan found himself growing increasingly bored with his life. Deep within, he knew he needed a change, a great adventure to reignite the passion for life that once burned brightly.

Nestled in the desert, Neot Smadar was a place of great natural beauty, with residents committed to sustainable living and community values. It was in this nurturing environment that Jonathan had grown up, and the kibbutz had left an indelible mark on him, shaping his character and life philosophy.

At the age of 25, Jonathan set out on a transformative journey to Italy, armed with nothing but a single backpack and a desire for personal growth. He relied on various modes of transportation, such as trains and buses, and even decided to cut his dreadlocks as a symbolic gesture of severing his connection to both conventional and Rainbow worlds.

As Jonathan ventured further into Italy, he began to play a game where he explored his understanding of good and evil within himself. He played the roles of both the "good" and "bad" versions of himself, observing the changes in his behavior, perceptions, and experiences.

Upon reaching the Rainbow Gathering, Jonathan was enchanted by the seed and main camps, where people from all walks of life came together to form a temporary community. He took on the role of an angel, responsible for maintaining peace and harmony within the gathering. However, his performance did not go as planned, leaving Jonathan questioning his role and purpose.

Later, a serendipitous encounter with poisonous mushrooms led to a profound realization. Jonathan decided to create a rainbow-colored show to share his insights and newfound understanding of life. The performance was a resounding success, and it became a turning point in his journey of self-discovery.

As Jonathan continued to explore his identity and purpose, his journey took him further into the realm of introspection and personal growth. His experiences in Italy would leave a lasting impact, shaping his perspective on life and the world around him.

Join Jonathan as he embarks on this unforgettable adventure, traversing the Italian countryside and delving deep into his own psyche. This is a tale of transformation, self-discovery, and the courage to embrace life in all its colorful complexity.

Once upon a time, in a kibbutz called Neot Smadar, nestled amidst the vast desert landscapes, there lived a young man named Jonathan Klein. Jonathan, the undisputed king of dishwashing, found himself trapped in the monotonous routines of daily life. Deep within, he knew he needed a change, a grand adventure to reignite the passion for life that once burned brightly within him.

Growing up in Neot Smadar, Jonathan was surrounded by natural beauty and a community of residents committed to sustainable living and strong values. This nurturing environment shaped his character and life philosophy, leaving an indelible mark on his soul. Yet, even in such an idyllic setting, Jonathan's restless spirit longed for something more, a challenge that would take him beyond the familiar boundaries of his kibbutz life.

On the cusp of turning 25, Jonathan resolved to embark on a transformative journey to Italy. Armed with nothing more than a single backpack, a heart filled with wanderlust, and a burning desire for personal growth, he set out on an adventure that would change his life forever. Jonathan relied on various modes of transportation, such as trains and buses, as he traversed the Italian countryside. In a symbolic act of transformation, he cut off his dreadlocks, severing his connection to both conventional and Rainbow worlds, ready to embrace the unknown and the countless experiences that lay ahead.


As Jonathan ventured deeper into the picturesque Italian countryside, he sought new ways to challenge himself and expand his horizons. One day, while contemplating the ever-changing landscape, an idea struck him: a game that would explore the concepts of good and evil, black and white, within his own character. This game would not only test his understanding of himself but also serve as a catalyst for personal growth.

To begin, Jonathan decided to embody the "white" character, representing virtues like kindness, empathy, and harmony. He focused on spreading positivity, engaging in meditative practices, and bringing peace to those he encountered on his journey. As he embraced this role, Jonathan noticed subtle changes in his interactions with others and his outlook on life. He began to appreciate the beauty in simplicity and the power of connecting with others on a deeper level.

Next, Jonathan transitioned into the "black" character, embodying traits like defiance, rebellion, and self-interest. This version of himself was markedly different from the "white" character, pushing boundaries and challenging societal norms. He discovered that this persona allowed him to confront aspects of himself that he had previously ignored or suppressed, forcing him to come to terms with his own darkness and complexity.

Throughout this game, Jonathan continued to push his limits and explore the depths of his character. He learned that the notions of good and evil, black and white, were not as clear-cut as they seemed. Instead, they were intertwined and shaped by his own experiences, beliefs, and circumstances.

As he delved deeper into this exploration, Jonathan's journey took on new meaning, transforming into an odyssey of self-discovery and personal growth. The black and white game became a catalyst for change, enabling him to develop a deeper understanding of his identity and his place in the world, as he continued to embrace the countless adventures that lay ahead.

Growing up in the kibbutz Neot Smadar, I was surrounded by natural beauty, sustainable living, and a strong sense of community values. But even in this idyllic environment, I couldn't escape the feeling of boredom and restlessness that plagued my days as the king of dishwashing. I knew that I needed a change, an adventure that would challenge me and reignite my passion for life.

At the age of 25, I made the decision to embark on a transformative journey to Italy. With nothing more than a backpack and a heart full of wanderlust, I set out to explore the Italian countryside, using trains and buses as my primary modes of transportation. The oppressive heat convinced me to cut off my dreadlocks, symbolically severing my ties to convention and embracing the unknown.

Throughout my journey, I found myself growing increasingly bored once again. To challenge myself and break free from the monotony, I devised a game of black and white, exploring the contrasting aspects of my personality. This game ultimately led me to the decision to create a show, a colorful expression of my newfound insights.

It was during this time that I began to see myself as an "angel." This new persona empowered me to help and connect with others in meaningful ways. Upon arriving at the Rainbow Gathering in Italy, I continued to embrace this role, assisting and connecting with fellow gatherers at both the Seed Camp and Main Camp.

One day, while attempting to lift a heavy, steaming pot without proper protection, I burned my hands. Undeterred, I used this incident to create a spectacle. Employing "technology," I enlisted the help of volunteers who spoke multiple languages to pass messages around the fire circle. Despite my efforts, the spectacle fell short, lacking vision and insight.

Then, a poisonous mushroom incident threw the gathering into disarray. It was during this chaotic time that I encountered an army doctor who seemed to represent a guardian presence. With the community coming together, we overcame the challenge, culminating in a celebratory rainbow-colored show that brought us all closer together.

As I left the gathering, I carried with me the lessons learned, the connections I had made, and the cherished memories of my time there. My adventure had forever changed me, helping me grow as a person and understand the complexities of the world around me.
