title:
Tales of the Void: Black Gold v1.5

The credits are rolling, we can hear the narrator as he voice overs the book - welcome everyone to the black gold novel… “Wellcome one, wellcome all”

The puppet narrator is sitting on an empty chair in the middle of a poorly illuminated dark stage.



[Fade in from black to the darkest grey]

Gather around children and let me tell you a dark and fascinating tale of the time before time ever existed…

The time before the Dinosaurs, before our beloved planet received the warm embrace of our sun planet.



Let me take you back in time and space, let us travel together to the inner most hidden part of the darkest wormhole that stretched into infinite space and stood in glorious solitude.



At the deep end of that blackest well was a sleeping dream. 



That dream was just starting to move and shift in its eternal slumber - it floated endlessly in this cocoon, embroiled by silhouettes and dark non existent thoughts.



Then a change came - a mighty one indeed - and this is the miracle of our entire existence.

You may stop and question me how all this is even possible? How could it be that for eons of decades that passed like a tiny fleeting moment- how could it be that for such an immensity of time nothing ever was and more to the point- how could this source of emptiness actually produce something?



This is all very paradoxical - I for one cannot begin to explain it for it is beyond my capacity as a being.

Now comes the good part - you might ask who am i… who is i am talking to and where are we?



These are all very good questions, I think we are all sleeping down here - this is just a dream…

[Fade to black]



[Fade in to a very obscure room]

A dark figure is sitting on a chair, supervising a bed, the bed is in a center of a very large room, there are tubes and lines, in the background we can hear monitors and some beeping noises.

The figure sitting is a wooden puppet, it sits in a crouched position, when the camera approaches her it begins to tilt.

“Hello and good morning to you dear reader…”

“You must be wondering what is this place? What is this story all about?”

“All i can tell you at this very moment is that all will be revealed soon… but I can definitely try to draw your attention to the sleeping man that lies in this very bed.”

“This man is named Adam, and he is about to undergo a voyage like no other…”

“Right now the body of Adam is vacant, his medical condition is Coma but in reality that 21 grams of wonder that we call the soul is vacant , at the moment it is just an empty vessel”

“Well I guess you have still a lot of questions and i would love to explore some of those with you, the problem is that the show you are viewing must come to an unfortunate end…”

“Just one last notion before we depart- have you ever thought about reincarnation in one’s own body?

I mean have you ever thought if it is possible to die and reborn inside your own skin?

A scary thought now- isn’t it? I for one find it delightful - just like a Phoenix rising out of it’s own ashes…”

“Well I got to leave you now - my deepest fleeting consciousness…”

[The grey room fades to black.]



We are flying through time and space, we reside in eternal darkness.

But then a change starts to happen, a miracle of movement, the beginning of a dream…

There is a slither of light, it is moving across the vast space - that ray of light is shimmering and sparkling in the black night - a tiny twinkling star.

But if we approach that tiny star it is no longer the size of a spec of dust but rather a huge planet with spheres and eruptions and scorching twirls of spontaneous combustions.

The light is tremendous - it sends rays everywhere. 

I am seeing this great ball of fire, I think it is the sun, so near, so powerful…

It warms my face and comforts me, singing lullabies to me… it nourishes me and feeds me in this darkness.

This is my womb, i feel the time has come - i am about to be born



Enter Lilith:

“My eyes are open, i can see…. Each day that I look into the mirror I am seeing myself.

And the image is good, but underneath the makeup I know that my soul is tormented…  My poor puppet of husband doesn’t show any signs of recovery… such a rough ordeal, but I guess it is better this way - for him to say the least.

I just wish for things to get back to the way they were before the syndicate deployed the drones.

Before the stock market crashed due to the false pandemic…

Sounds a bit apocalyptic but in the snakes mob it is quite ordinary, me? I’m used to all that Huss and fuss…

Still just to imagine a different world, sometimes I have sort of dreams about another life… sweet dreams where I am free to love, to live like all other humans… the ones living ordinary lives.”



[somewhere in space]

The floor is illuminated, a man is sleeping on a bed, the bed is floating in space, lines and vines are flying all around… the bed is rotating near the vortex of a giant dust whirlpool…

The man’s eyes are tightly shut, he holds his bed linen tightly while the bed is being sucked into the giant wormhole - the man is dreaming of this very moment in which a rip is made inside the very fabric of time and space.



I am the darkness, all encompassing, all swallowing, I live inside a tiny shell of no existence…

I am a dream.



I feel something stirring in the back of my mind… It is a sensation of being, becoming whole i guess.

I feel that all of my life I kept running away from conflict, and whenever an opportunity was heading my way I elegantly dodged.

I a but a feeble, fragile man, a Humpty Dumpty empty shell… but inwards I know there’s life in me, I want to break free from this cycle of emptiness and nothingness, would like to become a real man.

So more dreams come my way and I ponder the nature of existence while being immersed in this dreams. 

But just like a fetus aspiring to be born I  stretch my consciousness forward towards the light.

At first i cannot feel my body at all, then I start to feel my heavy eyelids as they cover my sight like black dark curtains.

And there is a numb pain covering each and every aspect of my body, a drowsiness that feels like heavy sedation - I just come to the realization that I rest on my back covered in tubes.

I am falling, endlessly falling into the bottom of the well - but now comes the strange part- it just never stops- this gives me a vertigo.

My eyes are closed but i see colors - inside.

My body is numb but i feel like I can move it perhaps - if ill keep on trying.

Then i hear a comforting voice at the back of my head.



Hello man. Yes, you are one.

You are a man and you exist, the reason for which you do not know yet, but let me tack you back a little to your birth.

You see we are both travelers in space you and i. We are floating fleeting specs of light traveling at the speed of dust.

So tell me, what would you like to be when you are born?

This is our birth - wellcome to the world, say hello.

It was at this moment that Adam realized he was being born.

But this moment of birth wasn’t just a singular event - it was the birth of all things - of all planets and constellations - of all moons and suns and stars and nebulas.



There’s been a change in his condition, poor man, I actually had the notion that this “accident” might be a fast release for him, that somehow this way he could be free of it all - without consequences…

They call me to get back to that despised hospital, just for another routine visit but this time it sounds like a change - it sounds as if a new process has begun, I actually pity the man very much, poor soul, Adam, you should have stayed in coma….



Lilith continues to play a double role in Adam’s life - on the one hand she is his guardian, on the other she reports his every movement.
Adam is undergoing a session of recovery, slowly but surely… he still feels like a new infant baby in a new body - this world is on known to him - he is a new soul.
The treatment is going well and Adam is transferred to his private mansion, he tries to ask Lilith about his past life - the source of richness for instance- but she does not cooperate with him.
On the other hand Lilith tells the other side of the story - how she feels secluded and overburdened with this task of keeping watch on Adam.
Lilith dreams of the new Adam, she opens up to him in her dreams but in reality she feels even more alienated - as if this is a completely unknown stranger - she stops to feel pity for him and more into curiosity.
The chapter ends with Adam feeling trapped in his old life, feels like he is betrayed by everyone surrounding him.
