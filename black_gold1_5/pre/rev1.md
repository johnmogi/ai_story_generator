As a critic, I would like to offer some suggestions to refine the structure and guidelines for the "Black Gold" chapter. Here are my recommendations:

Opening: Begin the chapter with a brief but captivating introduction to the concept of the endless void. This will set the stage for the psychological themes and the dream-like state that the chapter will explore.

Adam's gradual awakening: Present a more gradual process of Adam waking up in the villa, incorporating elements of physiotherapy and his disorientation. This can create a smoother transition from his unconscious state to his consciousness, allowing the reader to better empathize with his situation.

Introduction of Lilith: Establish Lilith as a central character early in the chapter. Provide some background information on her, including her motives and her life as an escort or criminal. This will make her character more relatable and add depth to her role in the story.

Dialogues and interactions: Incorporate more dialogues and interactions between Adam and Lilith. This will help develop their characters and create a clearer sense of the dynamics between them.

Dreams and visions: Integrate the puppet show dreams and other black dreams into the chapter in a coherent manner. Weave these dreams into the narrative, creating a contrast between Adam's dream world and his reality.

The Garden of Eden reversal: Elaborate on the concept of reversing the roles of the snake, Adam, and Lilith. Make sure to explain this idea clearly and explore its implications in the story.

The escape plan: Develop the idea of the "sphere of knowledge" or the hidden file that will help Adam and Lilith escape from the villa. This can serve as a central plot device, driving the story forward and providing a sense of urgency.

Tension and conflict: Build tension and conflict between Adam and Lilith as they struggle to trust each other and work together. This can create emotional depth and make their eventual cooperation more satisfying.

By following these suggestions, the "Black Gold" chapter will have a stronger structure, better character development, and a more engaging narrative. These improvements will help draw the reader into the story and make the chapter a more compelling part of the overall novel.
