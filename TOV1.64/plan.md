- this is the master novel for a series of 9 novels, all different in style
- the first part which is exclusive to this master novel is the introduction which tales the real tale of how i started with this project.

- to craft this project I am using a conjunction of 5 different spiritual theories:

1 - i took the indian Chakras and added the tao yin and yang as two additional chakras:
yin- the black is renamed to black gold and it is the sleeping chakra - the identification in which all man reside.
yang- the white is now white gold and it is the dimension of love and compassion an awakened being reaches at full mastery of self completion (it is beyond nature)

2 - (john mogi theory of dual creation) i also inserted the yin and yang into the book of genesys of the old testament, by choosing to follow the notion that the story of creation as it is depicted is actually 2 stories hat continue on the same timeline with the addition of tao and simple guidance of love and equality a new vision is unfolding that manifests complete balance in nature and also helps to realise the role of each energy - male and female.

3 - stephen de ropp the master game book covers the 9 games + 5 rooms of consciesness.
4 - the ennagram by gurdjieff and ouspensky
6 - the connoly tarot deck - the hidden message towards the angels and elements and small riddles inside this lovely deck 

a short recap of each chapter:

0. my black and white journey in the land of the colored children.

- at the age of 25 aprox. I went to italy doing a solo trek from rome to north of Toscany- the destination - the annual european rainbow gathering
- after a month of solo traveling during which allready on the first week i took a haircut removing my short dreadlocks I arived at toscany and out of boredom mostly started a black and white game image 
- in the BW game at day time i would play the role of white, slow, focused and meditative, i would cook my 1 daily meal of plain white rice and chow it slowly, at night i played the role of black, smoking ciggaretes and prowling the nearbye village looking for pleasure (mostly ice cream)
- after a day or so the games got mixed , i found myself smoking a cigarette at the midst of the daily meditation and playing with children
