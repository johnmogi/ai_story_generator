i am writing a novel named tales from the void.
for this novel i am using the following spiritual concepts and theories:
- the tao
- the book of genesys
- the indian chakras
- the ennagram
- the master game (stephen de ropp)
 
the novel outline is as follows:
0. the journey of the black and white man into the land of color:
- my personal journey in italy 20 years ago in which i took a trek to italy for a rainbow gathering and invented a solo game of black and white, resulting in a big performance.
[failed attempts, self image, spiritual growth, mushroom poisning, chkra performance]
1. black gold: reborn shaddows.
- the story of Adam as he travels inwardly, on the brink of death - inside a deep coma to the outskirts of reality where he encounters the paradoxical source of life - then he returns as a changed man, through an escapade of dreams and visions he regins his senses only to discover his old body trapped in a governament living conspiracy, sheapered by his fake wife lilith...
[cosmos creation, dark spiritual journey, roots rediscovery, reality mixed light horror, psychological growth]
2. tribal red: nsfw
- this is the side of lilith we will explore her dark past, what made her pull the trigger on Adam against her commanders and her rebeliious double crossing nature, as a "cloak" operative she tries to inflitrate the serpemtine rogue organisation that is also targeting Adam, everyone is searching for the reality bending skill
[sensual dreams, desire, agrressive, dark thriller]
3.  orange fierce
in this part Adam finaly faces off lilith for the fight for his freedom, at first the battle goes back and forth then she finally loses by her choice and joins him in a loving embrace, they will now have to face a giant lurking figure then an army, then some more exaggerated action scenes.
4. ocean blue
After the aftermath with snake which leaves both adam and lilith deeply wounded both physically and spiritualy they revert back into the dreaming world, where they plunge into the deep ocean and inwardly into outer space - hoghly visual dreamy chapter
5. purpelicous
Adam and lilith explore the mystical world, they aquire the mind bending reality shifting skill
6. white gold
Adam and lilith come back to earth after a long space voyage in which they realise there is only life on planet earth, even in the multitude of dimensions - they dismantle all governaments and weapons creating th eutopia for the human race.

I skipped some missing chapters, initially i wanted to have 9 chapters but there is too much ground to cover, trying to proceed without the missing yellow and green and another deep blue (either the crown or third eye chakra)

I want you to act as CRITIC and first point at all of the story weaknesses and missing consistency

<!-- As a critic, I would like to point out several weaknesses and inconsistencies in your novel outline:

Unclear focus on spiritual concepts: While you have listed several spiritual concepts and theories, it is not clear how they are incorporated into the narrative. The connections between these concepts and the plot should be made more explicit, so that readers can understand the underlying themes and messages.

Lack of character development: Aside from Adam and Lilith, there are no other characters mentioned in the outline. Introducing more characters and their roles in the story will help create a richer, more complex narrative. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the motivations and background of Adam and Lilith in greater depth.

Inconsistent pacing: Some chapters seem to be packed with action and plot development, while others appear to be more introspective and slow-paced. To keep readers engaged, it is important to balance the pacing throughout the novel.

Missing chapters: As you have mentioned, there are missing chapters in the outline. These gaps may lead to an uneven narrative structure and make it difficult for readers to follow the story. It is important to either fill in these gaps or revise the existing chapters to create a coherent storyline.

Unclear stakes and conflicts: It is not clear what is at stake for Adam and Lilith or what obstacles they must overcome in their journey. The conflicts should be well-defined and have a clear impact on the characters' growth and development.

Overuse of cliches: Certain elements in your outline, such as the government conspiracy and the quest for a reality-bending skill, are common tropes in science fiction and fantasy. To make your story stand out, consider subverting these cliches or exploring more unique and original ideas.

Abrupt ending: The ending, where Adam and Lilith dismantle all governments and create a utopia, seems sudden and unrealistic. It would be helpful to explore the challenges and consequences of their actions, as well as how the spiritual concepts you've introduced factor into the resolution.

To address these issues, consider revising your outline to incorporate the spiritual concepts more explicitly, develop your characters further, balance the pacing, fill in the missing chapters, clarify the stakes and conflicts, and explore the implications of the ending. This will help create a more engaging and cohesive narrative for your readers. -->
