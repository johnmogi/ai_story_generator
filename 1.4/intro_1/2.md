Chapter 1: The Journey Begins (Black)

Jonathan had always felt a restless energy within him, a longing to escape the confines of his mundane life. At the age of 25, he decided to take a leap of faith and travel to Italy. With only a backpack and rastas, he set out on a journey that would change him forever. His feet pounded the pavement as he made his way through the rugged terrain, cooking his own meals and doing his laundry outside. His body ached, but his spirit soared as he felt the freedom of the open road.

As he traveled, Jonathan began to play a game with himself. He explored his ideas of good and bad, acting out different characters and personalities.

But when he became the bad character, he sought pleasure and indulged in his desires without restraint.

He decided to write a novel, "The Yenzen Project," to help mankind overcome communication problems.

Chapter 6: Separation from Sylvera (Red)

After leaving the Rainbow Gathering, Jonathan went to France and separated from his girlfriend, Sylvera. He continued his journey as Angel, writing his novel and feeling a sense of purpose.
