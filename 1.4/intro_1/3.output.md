Jonathan had never felt more alive than when he was on the road. He relished the challenge of making his way through the Italian countryside on foot. The sun beat down on him as he hiked through the rolling hills, his backpack heavy with all he needed to survive. He stopped to rest beside a pristine lake that shimmered in the sunlight, the water so clear he could see the rocks on the bottom. The beauty of the place filled him with a sense of wonder and he knew that he was exactly where he was supposed to be.

As he continued his journey, he reached the city of Civitavecchia, a place that kissed the sea. He felt a sense of accomplishment at having traveled so far, but also a sense of isolation. He had grown his dreadlocks long, a symbol of his freedom, but he knew that in the cultured world, he was considered unwanted. He decided to cut his hair as a symbolic gesture, severing his ties to the society he had left behind. Now, he was truly on his own.

He continued on, hiking through Tuscany towards his destination, Piede Pelago. But along the way, he grew bored with his trip. To combat the tedium, he started to play a game with himself, exploring his ideas of good and bad. He would act as what he thought his image of good was, being meditative and slow, and then switch to being the bad character, seeking company and indulging in his desires.

But as the game progressed, he began to see that the characters were starting to merge. The borders between good and bad began to blur, and he found himself meditating one moment and smoking the next. He felt himself seeking attention and company, juggling and playing with the children in the nearby village. He realized that this couldn't be all bad, that the two characters were inextricably linked.

He arrived at a desolate train station, in the middle of nowhere, and decided to make a drawing of how his inner demon served his higher angel. He knew that the cooperation between the two was a blessed union, and that the boundaries he had set for himself were just an illusion. With this new perspective, he ended his little game and set out on the next leg of his journey.
