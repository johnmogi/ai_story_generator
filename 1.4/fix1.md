Tales of the Void.
Status:The introduction is good (B&W man in the land of the colored). 
However - needs to bring in more personal touch and more people.
[bring the forward  + preface into BG]

<!-- In the acknowledgement change the 1st mom part:I am thankful for my mother and the way her research into the “dark bible” e.g. a book she wrote in that name - her passion for exploring the Bible had sparked my curiosity. -->

Move chapter 0 into the foreword.Chapter 0 - the BW man:
TONE CHANGE - it is me telling the story about myself - there is no 3rd person - I am talking to you the reader
<!-- .Missing - the arrival into Chivitvechia and the haircut (a stranger in both lands feeling) -->
<!-- There’s a repetition here both with the fireflies and the invention of the black and white game. -->
Missing the part with the enrollment as an artist and the show prep.the part where the games start to mix after a few days.The actual performance setting and location edit.Missing some structure around the actual failed solo performanceForeword 

- on the one hand its too naive - remember how this book would look in the wrong hands lol.You want to approach the topics in a gentle way.
a bit more descriptions around the first failed attempt to raise a performance.Mushroom in the woods part:Volunteering during the seed camp - to the point where I’ve been sort of caught lying for the good of the camp-How I did a small con to raise money and assistance for the camp- resulting in an Italian man purchasing some pots and other equipment for the camp.missing the retake of how it came around- both the balance between the 2 camps - the lack of 4 wheel drive and the announcements mechanism.The apostles - the people i had working on my side along with some foes and specifically the “fight scene” with the army man.The angels - the bandaged burned hands in a speech where angel extends his hand into the sun.The white medic - how one of the saviors dropped a white glove coming from the sky from a zip line.
+ the actual performance buildup - makeup and costumes - the colorful chakra rainbow show.
Preface + Puppet show intro.The puppet show is good, funny- maybe it should come sooner.Another approach is to implement those parts into the first chapter. Or even make this chapter composed of the dreams (love it!)
The aftermath - or how this Novel came into existence:using the chakras and the 2 bow colors.Looking for other ideas - songs and highly artistic messages.Using the Tao yin and yang with the genesis to suddenly discover a new message:“ god is the devil, heaven is hell and vice versa - man is acting as a destructive tool.
Chapter 1 - Black Gold:[TONE] sleepy and psychologically oriented.
before the beginning there was an endless void that went forever and ever.Nothing ever came into being - blah blah.How the world started inside a grain of dust.The thought process of the invisible grain of sand.
the puppet show dreams come here. Various black dreamsThe waking up process… i want more gradual process into the villa - including some physiotherapy.BRING IN LILITH as a 1st person with motive, narrative - originally this was a DIALOGUE.Fill in the view from here part - she will reveal the hidden parts with the snake and the underground scheme.The idea is to take the story of the garden of Eden and reverse it:The snake is god - he controls allAdam is out of control completely - from Coma to childish codependent state.Build Lilith character- maybe an escort girl, could be just that she grew up into a life of crime without an exit.Lilith is the active evolving unit - she is the bringer of change - trying to break with the situationPoisoned apple? The datura plant?A sphere of knowledge or a hidden file that will uncover the connections to start the escape from the locked “garden” that is the villa.So the novel goes on and on about Adam dreams at night, Adam thought process, Lilith visions about Adam that contradict her current position - she needs to trust herself a new.will there be an escape - no - a freeze - this is fight flight- freeze.
Chapter 2 - Tribal Red:[TONE] visually tempting and full of semi erotic details.
Cut out the puppet dream - back to the previous chapter - this is just another dream.
Adam is obsessed with his desires and lust towards Lilith, he realizes that this is a childish craving but he cannot help himself - whenever she is around he is stuck gazing at her.Lilith notices this craving and takes advantage, but underneath this lust game she looks for signs of awakening from him - could this be the man she dreams about?Adam is having weird sensual dreams, and and he is surprised to meet with Lilith in the dreaming world.They are plunged in hot, sexual fantasies - but they wake up each day to play the same roles - he plays the captive and she plays his captor.This is a tapestry of dreams visions and fantasies - mixing realities with illusions - somehow they wake from this peculiar mix to start their escape - now they are fleeing the villa and red hot lights are on their tale….It’s important to note that in the real world they still don’t trust or communicate with each other.The chapter should end with Adam trying to escape the locked villa garden after an nightmarish ordeal - but Lilith is blocking the path - she must not allow him to escape.
Chapter 3- Orange Fierce:[TONE] high octane fast paced action filled thriller.-
